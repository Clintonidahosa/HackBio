# Internship Tasks Repository

This repository contains tasks and projects completed during my internship phase. Each task focuses on applying data analysis techniques, statistical testing, and visualization to real-world datasets using R. The repository showcases my progress in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and statistical interpretation throughout the internship.

## Key Areas Covered:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation)
- Hypothesis testing using t-tests
- Insights into health-related datasets

Feel free to explore the code and methodologies used to complete each task.
