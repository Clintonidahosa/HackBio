### Unsupervised Learning(UL): Brief overview and key concepts</a>

Author (@slack): Idahosa Clinton (@doc_idahosa)

Unsupervised learning(UL), uses machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyse and cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention (IBM). It discovers patterns from intrinsic data structures without crafted labels, which is believed to be the key to real AI-generated decisions (Jing et al., 2022).

Some key concepts include: 

-Clustering (similar data points are grouped into clusters)

-Association (discovering relationships between variables or items)

-Dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features or variables in a data while preserving important information)

-Self organising maps (projection of high-dimensional data onto a lower dimensional representation- typically a 2D map)

-Generative models (generation of new data samples that resemble the original data)


### Role in Cancer Research</a>
UL has proven to be useful in the manipulation and exposition of patterns from cancer-related data. 
Firstly, stratifying patients based on genetic and clinical profile inorder to assess risk factors, progression and prognosis of cancer has never been more precise. In a study that evaluated the Association approach in analysing older adults with advanced cancer by Huiwen et al., 2023, UL partitioned patients into distinct symptom severity clusters and patients with higher pretreatment severity were more likely to experience hospitalisation and death.

Additionally, dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms have also been used to generate and identify novel biomarkers which may help in early detection of cancers or to identify patients more likely to respond to specific treatments. 



“Our findings advocate for the integration of advanced image analysis into the standard tumour micro-environment  characterization workflow to refine prognostic and therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer’’ (ASCO 2024). This was the conclusion of an experiment into the use of UL in prediction of tumour microenvironment subtypes.
Other uses of UL in cancer research include: Predictive modelling, anomaly detection, identifying novel drug targets, assessment of treatment response etc.



### Application - A Case Study</a>
A notable study used UL techniques on RNA data from breast cancer samples to show previously uncharacterized immune cell subtypes within the tumour micro-environment. This study identified new cell populations associated with immune evasion and response to therapy, offering new targets for immunotherapy (Yuanyuan et al., 2021). 

### Conclusion</a>
These illustrate how unsupervised learning, through techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction, is being utilised in cancer research today to enhance our understanding of the tumour microenvironment and improve therapeutic approaches.
